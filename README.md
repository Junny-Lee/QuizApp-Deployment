The timer (shown in the nav bar) begins as the quiz begins.

The quiz is made up of five questions. A few are shown here:

When the last question has been answered, the timer stops automatically. The user sees how well he/she did (+10 points for every correct answer, -5 points for every wrong answer).

When the user scrolls down a little bit, he/she has a chance to directly send me an email by filling out the form.

The user can also "See Correct Answers." All five questions that were on the quiz are shown along with the user's answers and correct answers.
